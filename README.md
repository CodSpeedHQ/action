  with:
    # [REQUIRED for private repositories]
    # The CodSpeed upload token: can be found at https://codspeed.com/settings
    # It's strongly recommended to use a secret for this value

# Example usage

## With `pytest` and [`pytest-codspeed`](https://github.com/CodSpeedHQ/pytest-codspeed)

This worklow will run the benchmarks found in the `tests/` folder and upload the results to CodSpeed.

It will be triggered on every push to the `main` branch and on every pull request.

```yaml
name: codspeed-benchmarks

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "main" # or "master"
  pull_request:
  # `workflow_dispatch` allows CodSpeed to trigger backtest
  # performance analysis in order to generate initial data.
